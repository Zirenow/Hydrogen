# Hydrogen - idvev branch
Welcome to unstable branch of Hydrogen
## Known flaws:
- Problems with refreshing data (makeshift solution is working but causes small memory leak)
- No convinient way to exit program (Use Left Ctr + C)

## Instalation
`git clone /this/repository/on/github`    
`git checkout indev` We change branch here

This branch has Makefile, so you can run two commands:    
`make install_windows`    
or     
`make install_linux`     

If your shell complains you probably don't have Make installed
